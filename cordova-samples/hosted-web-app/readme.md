# TACO Hosted App Sample Application

This is the complete source code for the sample application that accompanies the [TACO Hosted App tutorial]() <--ADD LINK THERE

The folder contains two subfolders:

+	**Starter** - The starter version of the application. It consists of just the web application portion of the tutorial. As you work through the tutorial, you'll add an Apache Cordova project to the solution and build on it.
+	**Completed** - The completed solution, what you'll have at the end of the tutorial. This version is for those impatient people who want to skip all the fun and work directly with the completed application project.
