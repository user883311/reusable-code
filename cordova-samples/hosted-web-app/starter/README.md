# Create a hosted app using Apache Cordova

Web developers can use Cordova to leverage existing web assets, get a web-based app uploaded to an app store, and get access to device features like the camera. For this sample, we want to show you a fast way to turn a Web site into a mobile app using Apache Cordova.

See the [tutorial that accompanies this sample](http://taco.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/create-a-hosted-app/).
