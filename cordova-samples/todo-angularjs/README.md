# Cordova Sample App - AngularJS TODO App
Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova combines the goodness of your favorite IDE with the ease of creating apps for multiple mobile operating systems, all in a simple to use workflow. One of the major pain points for our enterprise developers is the effort required to build apps for multiple platforms, while keeping costs and effort down. Visual Studio Tools for Apache Cordova allows developers to use HTML5 and JavaScript, along with their favorite open source framework libraries to build web applications.

Leveraging the Apache Cordova framework, we create packaged mobile apps that feel and behave like native device applications. What's great is that all this can be done completely from within Visual Studio, with full tooling support for building, debugging and packaging that our customers love. Our highlight features include attaching and debugging to the Android emulator and devices, plus, being able to build and simulate remotely for the iOS platform.

The TODO sample helps you get up and running with an app that you can F5 and start playing around with. It showcases the use of the Geolocation plugin from Cordova, that lets the app use native device capabilities. It also uses Microsoft Azure as its cloud backend, to sync and make data available on any device, at any time.


## Building the Sample
### [optional] Bing Maps API
For purposes of distribution, we have removed our API key. Please [create and copy over your Bing Maps API key](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff428642.aspx) for the app to work as expected. If the Bing Maps key is not present, the location information shows up as "<latitude>, <longitude>" in the app instead of the actual address.

### [optional] Microsoft Azure
For purposes of distribution, we have removed our API key and added a comment instead. The app falls back to local storage if you choose not to enter an API key.

If you are not familar with Azure, this guide to [creating a new Azure Mobile App and adding a table](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-cordova-get-started/) will be helpful.

This application looks for a Azure table named todoitem and a dynamic schema to handle changing columns.

Create your Azure Mobile App [Optional]
- Navigate to http://azure.microsoft.com
- Go to Portal and login with your Microsoft account
- Create a new Azure Mobile App and table by following instructions in [this article](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/app-service-mobile-cordova-get-started/). (You can skip instructions that help you create the client app. Just use this sample instead.)


### Running The App
You can download [VS Community 2015 RTM in English](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=524433) to get started right away (or [go here for other languages and editions](http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200626830)) and donâ€™t forget to include the Apache Cordova development tools during setup. After you have Visual Studio 2015 installed, you can open up the project in Visual Studio.

>**Note** You need at minimum Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 with the optional Cross-platform tools for HTML/JavaScript (Apache Cordova) installed.

Add any API keys as explained above. Press F5 and you're on your way! If you haven't already done so, consider taking a look at our landing page for more information (http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=398477).

#### What the script downloads
When you run the app for the first time, a Powershell script is executed on build and downloads some library files. You will need to have a working internet connection for the script to run correctly. Please note, this is a special step we have added to enable users to get the required libraries and is not a part of the standard Apache Cordova project template.

Path to downloaded files:
- scripts/frameworks/angular.min.js
- scripts/frameworks/angular-resource.min.js

**Note: The .jsproj file has been modified to include a call to the Powershell script for downloading the dependency libraries**



### Known Issues
- The Android 4.3 browser has some known limitations, and so the sample may not work perfectly on such devices
